# odin-recipes
This is my first GitHub repository.
Following The Odin Project, I created a very simple recipes page using HTML, that contains a landing page which leads to 3 recipes. 
The main aspect of this project was learning how to use WSL, and upload, modify and commit to GitHub using Git and Visual Studio Code.
